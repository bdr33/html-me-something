            <p>Piper took her first roadtrip in ***. She was headed to Petersburg, IN to meet her extended family and play on the "farm". 
                No one knew how she would do in the car, but she loved it! It was so great to watch the road with her face by Mom and Dad's.
                Unfortunately they did not agree and stopped an hour into the trip to get a backseat barrier. Oh well! </p>

            <p>Finally!!! Piper had proved herself a "good" dog and was invited to have Christmas at her grandparent's

                 miniature schnauzer. She followed Lexie everywhere, which Lexie did not enjoy.  </p>
