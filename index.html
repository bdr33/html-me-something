                Piper spent the first year of her life or so as a stray. She was rescued by Needy Paws Rescue after being 
                found in a field in North County. She then went to two foster homes before finding her forever home.

            <h2>Piper visits family in Petersburg</h2>

                Piper took her first roadtrip a few weeks after coming home. She was headed to Petersburg, IN to meet her 
                extended family and play on the "farm". No one knew how she would do in the car, but she loved it! It was 
                so great to watch the road with her face by Mom and Dad's. Unfortunately they did not agree and stopped an
                 hour into the trip to get a backseat barrier. Oh well! She compromised and put her face around the side so 
                 she wouldn't miss any of the action.

            <h2>Piper has Christmas in Decatur</h2>

                Finally!!! Piper had proved herself a "good" dog and was invited to have Christmas at her grandparent's
                 house! She was excited to sniff out the house and meet her new friends: Jazz the cat and Lexie the 
                 miniature schnauzer. She followed Lexie everywhere, which Lexie did not enjoy. She also got to "open" her
                  presents, a giant bone and a squeaky toy!

            <h2>Piper goes to Castlewood</h2>

                In February Piper went on her first hiking adventure at Castlewood. She wore her adventure harness and a great big doggy smile.
                Piper was a very fast hiker and kept her family on their toes with her sudden stops to sniff interesting spots. Piper 
                wasn't tired at all after her hike, so she had to run laps with her mom in a nearby field before going home to get more
                energy out. This was one of her favorite days so far!
